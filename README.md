# üíª Backend Ofinetplus E-Commerce üíª

This is a project where I have used PhP and Laravel for an E-Commerce.

As a client you can register, login or delete your account and see all the products and programs for sale. 

As an administrator you can view, create and delete any product in the e-commerce.
